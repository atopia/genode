    window_layouter: assignment of screens to displays
    
    This patch enhances the window layouter with the notion of displays
    and the assignment of screens to displays.
    
    Issue #5390

    wm/decorator/layouter: window clipping
    
    This patch changes the window-layout format to support the rectangular
    clipping of windows at screen boundaries. The new <boundary> node defines
    the clipping boundary for the windows listed within the node. Boundaries
    are expected to be disjoint. In the example below, the "vbox" window is
    placed partially outside the screen area of "screen_2".
    
    <window_layout>
      <boundary name="screen_1" xpos="0" ypos="0" width="640" height="480">
        <window id="1" title="launchpad" xpos="10" ypos="140" width="400" height=">
      </boundary>
      <boundary name="screen_2" xpos="640" ypos="0" width="800" height="600">
        <window id="2" title="vbox"     xpos="520" ypos="52" width="800" height="600">
        <window id="3" title="terminal" xpos="650" ypos="72" width="500" height="400">
      </boundary>
    </window_layout>
    
    The layouter uses boundaries to restrict the visiblilty of windows to
    their respective target areas.
    
    Until now, Sculpt relied on the fact that the window-layout ROM had the
    same structure as the resize-request ROM. With the addition of the
    <boundary> nodes, this is no longer the case. Therefore, the Sculpt
    manager generates a dedicated resize-request ROM now.

    window_layouter: drag windows between displays
    
    This patch allows the user to drag windows from one target area (i.e.,
    display) to another whereas the resizing of windows is restricted to
    the window's original target area. The latter point is important to
    ensure that the window's resize handles remain reachable at all times.

Date:   Thu Nov 28 16:54:35 2024 +0100

    window_layouter: allow screen-change during drag
    
    This patch enables the user to interactively change the assignment of
    windows to screens. For screens visible side by side in a multi-monitor
    setup, one can now move a window from one screen to another by dragging
    the window title. When using screens as virtual desktops on one display,
    a window can be moved to another screen by switching the screen (by
    pressing a key matching a desired screen) while the window is dragged
    with the mouse. So the user can drag the window between virtual desktops.

    window_layouter: modernized coding style
    
    Replace the use of pointers and the copying of XML nodes by the 'with_'
    pattern. Use plain struct where appropriate, replace constructors by { }
    initialization. Use C++20 function template syntax. Replace accessors by
    public constants where possible. Follow 'from_xml' convention. Follow
    usual 'Action' interface naming.

    window_layouter: restrict focus to visible windows
    
    This patch restricts the focus switching via the keyboard (Super-Tab) to
    windows located at visible screens.
    
    Should the currently focused window become invible, switch the focus to the
    most recently focused visible window.

    window_layouter: "pick_up" and "place_down" action
    
    The new 'action' attribute values can be used to realize the
    keyboard-based assignement of windows to screens. The "pick_up" action
    (on a key press) selects the focused window to be held at the current
    position until the "place_down" action is issued (by a key release).
    While the focused window is held, "screen" actions can be executed
    taking the picked up window to the selected screen.

    pkg/window_layouter: rules format change -> 24.12
    
    To accommodate multi-monitor window management, the window-layouter
    rules must be extended. By renaming the rules file to a version number
    reflecting the date of change (24.12), we prevent the loss of
    window-layout state when switching back and forth between different
    versions of the window-layouter.
    
    The default rules contain now the definition of three displays
    ("primary", "secondary", and "ternary") and map 3 screens to each
    display.

    window_layouter: handle drag/drop as actions
    
    This patch moves the formerly hard-wired drag-and-drop handling
    to the configuration level by introducing the actions "drag" and "drop".
    
    To aid the robust handling of release events matching their
    corresponding press events, the patch refines the policy-matching of the
    current combination of keys against the hierarchy of <press> and
    <release> nodes. If no policy for a concrete combination exists, a
    release event also considers the policy of its matching <press> node.
    This way, the regular drag-and-drop rules can be expressed as
    
      <press key="BTN_LEFT" action="drag">
         <release key="BTN_LEFT" action="drop"/>
      </press>
    
    This also works when releasing BTN_LEFT while pressing additional keys,
    for which no policy exists.
    
    With this change, the layouter supports the matching of multiple key
    sequences instead of only one, thereby supporting multiple actions at
    once and allowing for decoupling different user interactions in the
    configuration.
    
    Issue #5403

    window_layouter: free-arrange mode
    
    This patch adds the feature of moving and resizing windows by clicking
    anywhere within a window while the global window-management key is held.
    Depending on the position within the window, the click is interpreted as
    click on the title (when clicking at inner 50% of the window, or as a
    click on the border (when clicking at an area nearby the window
    boundary).
    
    This mode of interaction requires more flexibility of the handling of
    key sequences. The formerly hard-wired handling of the drag and drop as
    response to BTN_LEFT events does not suffice. Therefore, this patch
    moves the driving of the drag-and-drop state to the config level by
    introducing the actions "drag" and "drop"
    
    Fixes #5403

    vbox6: multi-monitor support
    
    Support dynamic panorama of virtual displays. Virtual monitors for
    VirtualBox must be configured in two steps.
    
    - <Display monitorCount="<num>"> nodes in the .vbox file defines the
      number of _connectors_ and, thus, the maximum number of connected
      virtual monitors.
    
    - Each enabled VirtualBox monitor requests a dedicated GUI session.
      Enablement and labeling of these sessions is done via <monitor>
      nodes in the component configuration like follows.
    
      <monitor label="DP-1"/>
      <monitor label="HDMI-A-1"/>
    
    Labels can be used by the window manager to configure and place the
    corresponding window. The order of the nodes directly controls the
    connection order at the virtual graphics card.

Base framework and OS-level infrastructure
##########################################

Init configuration improvements
===============================

; @nfeske

Simplified RAM assignments
--------------------------

In init's configuration, the assignment of RAM to a component is expressed as follows:

! <start name="report_rom">
!   ...
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!   ...
! </start>

We have now introduced a new 'ram' attribute as a concise alternative.

! <start name="report_rom" ram="2M">
!   ...
! </start>

This change is complemented with the ability of defining a global default RAM
quota following the existing pattern of the default caps definition, e.g. the
following '<default>' node alleviates the need to repeatedly state reasonable
'ram' and 'caps' values in each single start node.

! <default caps="100" ram="1m"/>


Partial session-label rewriting
-------------------------------

When
[https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/24.05/system_configuration/The_init_component.html#Session_routing - routing]
a session request, a route can be selected by using a label (or a label suffix
or a label prefix) as key.
In the target node ('<parent/>' or '<child name="..."/>'), it is possible to
[https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/24.05/system_configuration/The_init_component.html#Session-label_rewriting - replace]
the label by another one. For example, the following routing rule matches a
ROM session labeled "config". If the route is taken, the session is directed
to the config_fs_rom server and the label is rewritten to "managed/runtime".
So the server will hand out this file as ROM module, which then appears as
"config" at the client.

! <route>
!   ...
!   <service name="ROM" label="config">
!     <child name="config_fs_rom" label="managed/runtime"/> </service>
!   ...
! </route>

In hierarchic scenarios (e.g., nested instances of init), labels assume a form
like "runtime -> system_shell -> terminal -> config". The client's intent (in
this case, the client wants to obtain "config") is successively watermarked by
the components in the chain of authority involved in the session creation.
In the example, the terminal's session request traverses the system-shell init
as well as the runtime init before reaching the server.

In short, the label encodes two things: the expression of the client's intent
(naming a server-provided resource like ROM module), and an unforgeable (by
the client) representation of the client's identity as observed by the server.
The former is the last part of the label whereas the latter are all the
leading parts.

Init's label rewriting mechanism is a useful tool of abstraction, which allows
for grouping clients to roles. However, as the label can only be rewritten as
a whole, the rewriting rule needs to know both the client's identity and the
client's intent. Should the client's intent vary (e.g., a client requesting a
variety of ROM modules), a dedicated rewriting rule is needed for each case.
By introducing the following new attributes for the selective rewriting of
only the identity or the resource part of the label, such policies become much
easier to express.

:'identity="rw"': replaces the identity part of the label by "rw" while
  keeping the resource part. So the client's identity can be replaced by
  a role while keeping the client's intent intact.

:'resource="/bin/"': replaces the client's intent while retaining the
  client's identity. Here, a client's request for a file-system session
  becomes hardwired to one directory of the server.

:'prepend_resource="/usr/local"': prepends the resource part of the label with
  a given prefix. The example restricts the client-provided path to the
  bounds of the server's /usr/local/ directory, as a substitute for the
  traditional chroot component.


Enriched file-system session-label convention
=============================================

Genode 25.02 changes the way of how a client-selected sub directory is
communicated to the file-system server at session-creation time. The former
opaque session argument is now passed as last label element, which allows for
the flexible tweaking of this argument by init's session-routing and
label-rewriting mechanisms. In particular, it alleviates the need for creating
chroot component instances.

This change requires the following four adaptations at the configuration
level:

* Each file-system session request must now carry a path starting
  with / as last session argument. Hence, '<fs>' nodes of the VFS that
  feature a 'label' attribute must extend the attribute value
  with " -> /". For '<fs>' nodes with no label attribute, "/" is
  used as last label argument by default.

* For matching session-routing rules at init's configuration,
  the matching of full labels must be replaced by 'label_prefix'
  matches, excluding the last (path) argument.

* Wherever a label of a file-system session is rewritten by using
  init's 'label' attribute in a '<parent>' or '<child>' target node,
  the new attribute 'identity' should be used instead. This replaces
  the identity part of the label while preserving the client's
  directory argument.

* Analogously to the matching of session-routing rules, server-side
  policy-selection rules that formerly matched a concrete 'label'
  must be changed to match a 'label_prefix' instead.

As a good practice, 'label_prefix' values should end with " ->" if possible,
which clearly delimits the identity part of the label used by the matching.


SIMD optimizations
==================

With screen resolutions growing, the proliferation of multi-monitor setups,
and in anticipation of screen-rotation support later this year, our existing
pixel-shovelling routines show their limitations. This prompted us to
investigate the use of SIMD (single instruction multiple data) for such
purpose, leveraging ARM Neon on the 64-bit ARM architecture and SSE4 on the
64-bit x86 architecture.

We put our attention on two well known bottlenecks, namely the back-to-front
blitting performed by display drivers and alpha blending performed by the
nitpicker GUI server. The existing blit library has been extended by two new
interfaces 'Blit::back2front' and 'Blit::blend_xrgb_a' accommodating these use
cases. With the planned support for screen rotation in the back of our heads,
the 'back2front' implementation supports the rotation by 0, 90, 180, and 270
degrees as well as screen flipping.

Our effort spent on the SIMD optimizations paid off. The new versions improve
the performance roughly by factor 3 compared to our original routines.
Non-SIMD implementations of the same interfaces are available as fallback,
which is employed on 32-bit architectures and RISC-V.

Device drivers
##############

User-space IOMMU support for IRQ remapping
==========================================

While adding kernel-agnostic DMA protection in Genode
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/23.11#Kernel-agnostic_DMA_protection - 23.11],
we intentionally left IRQ protection out of scope. This release completes the
kernel-agnostic IOMMU enablement on Intel platforms by adding IRQ-remapping
support to the platform driver.

Since the platform driver already controls the MSI/MSI-X enablement for PCI
devices, setting up the corresponding remapping tables was rather straightforward.
Integrating remapping support for legacy interrupts, however, was a bit more
involved. It required us to also add support for the
_I/O APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller)_
to the platform driver. Similar to how the
_DMA Remapping Hardware Unit Defintions_ (DRHDs) are reflected in the _acpi_
report generated by the ACPI driver and added to the _devices_ report by our
PCI decode component, the available I/O APICs are now also part of the _devices_
report. With the added information, the platform driver is able to take over
control of the interrupt controller and set up IRQ remapping unless the
kernel already enabled IRQ remapping. Since the NOVA kernel already implements
IRQ remapping, the platform driver's I/O APIC and IRQ-remapping logic is
only effective on our base-hw kernel.

Note, as a prerequisite for handling IRQ remapping tables, we also needed to switch
from using the register-based invalidation interface to the queued invalidation
interface, which is the new default (if supported by the platform).


Sculpt-OS compatibility with F&S i.MX 8MP armStone
==================================================

During the last six month a lot effort was taken to support additional NXP i.MX
8M Plus centered devices, like the Compulab IOT Gateway and the MNT Pocket
Reform. With the current release, we extend the row of devices capable to run
Sculpt OS by another board featuring this SoC, namely the armStone board from
F&S Embedded.

As it is based on the same SoC, we could re-use most drivers for platform, USB,
MMC, or Ethernet. But to drive the more complex and board specific conglomerate
of display engine and differing connectors (HDMI instead of MIPI-DSI), we ported
an alternative framebuffer driver from the vendor's Linux kernel fork to Genode.

With most peripheral drivers in place, we can now provide another instance of
Sculpt-OS running on top of the armStone board. To facilitate the build of an
SD-card image, you can extend the RUN_OPT variable by:

! RUN_OPT += --include image/armstone_sdcard

This will automatically create an SD-card image, whenever you execute a
run-script for the armStone board, e.g.:

! make run/sculpt_image BOARD=imx8mp_armstone

The resulting SD-card image is not bootable directly, as the board relies on
booting from eMMC. Instead a second-stage loadable u-boot is placed in the
image, which is capable to load our system-image that is slightly too large to
be loaded by the pre-installed bootloader.


USB
===

We addressed a short-coming when selecting USB endpoints, where only the
interface number was considered in the selection process and the alternate
settings number was ignored. Thereby the order in which the interface
descriptors were iterated was accidentally determining the endpoint addresses
that were communicated to the client, i.e. the USB device driver.

In case of mass-storage devices, like external SSDs, the 'usb_block' driver
tried to operate the device with the endpoint addresses belonging to the
USB-Attached-SCSI (UAS) alternate setting rather than the bulk-only interface
it supports.

With the fix that includes the alternate setting number in the selection
process in place the order is now of no consequence and the affected devices
are working again.


Audio
=====

In order to improve user experience, especially with regard to video
conferencing, we extended our [https://www.openbsd.org - OpenBSD] based audio
driver with an option to customize microphone selection. The <config> node of
the audio driver now supports a 'mic_priority' attribute. Supported values are
"internal" and "external" (default). In case two microphones are present, e.g., a
headset and an internal microphone on a notebook, a value of "internal" will
enable the speakers of the headset and the microphone of the notebook, while
"external" will enable the microphone of the headset.


Platforms
#########

Execution on bare hardware (base-hw)
====================================

Genode's custom kernel supports the notion of IPC-helping since the very
beginning. This concept means that one thread calling another one via an
Inter Process Communication (IPC) message, will borrow its own scheduling-abilities to the
target thread. As the caller will block until it gets a response, it is a
nice property to pass its time to the target side, which acts on behalf of
the caller anyway.
This nice concept was originally adopted from the Nova kernel. However, in
contrast to Nova and some other L4-like microkernels, the base-hw kernel does
not use the IPC mechanism to forward page-faults to the pager thread that should
resolve it. Thereby, all scheduling parameters, like priorities and CPU quantums
that we can distribute in the system, are valid across component boundaries when
using RPC, but not in case of page-faults. But this can lead to unwanted
interferences in between components of different priority that depend on the
same pager thread.
Therefore, we have generalized the notion of helping in our custom kernel to
borrow a thread's scheduling properties not only when doing IPC, but also when a
page-fault got triggered. Moreover, there is not only one global pager thread
available anymore, but one pager thread per CPU.

To aid debugging during development of the basic system, e.g.: when adding new
features or new platforms to the kernel, we add additional recognition and
information printing about the hardware state during a fault when executing a
core's thread or kernel context.

    hw: calibrate TSC via ACPI timer
    
    To get the Time Stamp Counter's frequency, hw relied on a complex and
    incomplete algorithm.
    
    Since this is a one-time initialization issue, move TSC calibration to
    bootstrap and implement it using the ACPI timer.

    hw: calibrate Local APIC via ACPI timer
    
    Upto now, bootstrap used the Programmable Interval Timer to set a
    suitable divider and determine the frequency of the Local APIC.
    The PIT is not available on recent x86_64 hardware anymore.
    
    Move Local APIC calibration to bootstrap and use the ACPI timer as a
    reference. Clean up hw's timer implementation a little and disable the
    PIT in bootstrap.

    hw: always serialize rdtsc reads
    
    While implementing TSC calibration in #5215, the issue of properly serializing
    TSC reads came up. Some learnings of the discussion were noted in #5430.
    
    Using `cpuid` for serialization as in Trace::timestamp() is portable,
    but will cause VM exits on VMX and SVM and is therefore unsuitable to
    retain a roughly working calibration loop while running virtualized.
    On the other hand on most AMD systems, dispatch serializing `lfence`
    needs to be explicitly enabled via a non-architectural MSR.
    
    Enable setting up dispatch serializing lfence on AMD systems and always
    serialize rdtsc accesses in Hw::Tsc::rdtsc() for maximum reliability.

Build system and tools
######################

Goa SDK
=======

While working on several ports of 3rd-party software using the Goa SDK, we
further tweaked its support of commodity build systems. This includes the
propagation of shared-library linker flags and the execution of 'make install'
in autoconf-based and make-based projects. Moreover, Goa used to symlink the
complete content from a project's _src/_ directory into the build directory.
As this could create ping-pong effects with generated files, Goa now leaves
generated files untouched (unless provided with the '--rebuild' flag).

Autoconf-based projects are now pointed to the used API archives for looking up
pkg-config files. This prevents pkg-config from accidentally pulling library
information from the host system and instead only take this information from
_*.pc_ files in the referenced depot archives.

Furthermore, we updated the built-in depot archive versions to Sculpt 24.10.3.


Compilation changes
===================

The use of ARM Neon and Intel SSE4 in the context of the SIMD optimizations
mentioned in Section [SIMD optimizations], we encountered two limitations of
our tool chain's default behavior.

First, even though Genode does not depend on the host system's C library (a
few hybrid Genode/Linux components notwithstanding), the tool chain defines
'__STDC_HOSTED__' by default. This becomes a problem when using the ARM-Neon
compiler intrinsics, which rely on the compiler's _stdint.h_, which in turn
expects the presence of a C library whenever '__STDC_HOSTED__' is set. To
discharge this wrong expectation, we explicitly specify the '-ffreestanding'
compiler argument by default now. In the rare case of a hybrid Genode/Linux
component, this default can be overridden by setting 'CC_OPT_FREESTANDING' to
an empty value in the target's build-description file.

Second, the tool chain does not allow for the use of SSE4 compiler intrinsics
on x86 by default. Instead of merely enabling SSE4 via the '-msse4' compiler
argument, we decided to globally switch to the '-march=x86-64-v2' profile to
denote the processor generation with all its features as common base line.
The profile corresponds to Intel Core processors of the year 2010 or newer.


Streamlined handling of run-script preconditions
================================================

Not all run scripts are compatible with all kernels, boards, architectures, or
circumstances. Usually, such constraints had been expressed by statements
like this:

! if {![have_board pc]} {
!   puts stderr "only supported on PC hardware"
!   exit 0
! }

Over the years and with the number of run scripts growing, those preconditions
have become complex and many. Moreover, run scripts backing out because of
an unsatisfied precondition are not easy to distinguish from successful run
scripts when executed in automated fashion. Thanks to the welcome
[https://github.cokm/genodelabs/genode/issues/5432 - initiative] of Roman Iten
of [https://gapfruit.com - Gapfruit, the precondition checks for executing
run scripts have now become largely streamlined and much simpler.

The run tool has been extended by an 'assert' function that is dedicated for
expressing the preconditions of a run script. So the above example becomes:

! assert {[have_board pc]}

Note that the message can be dropped because any unsatisfied precondition
is conveniently printed in the log. However, a more instructive message can
be specified as an optional second argument.

To make this pattern as ergonomic and natural as possible, the naming of the
run tool's various checking functions have been unified and slightly extended.
The former 'get_cmd_switch' and 'get_cmd_arg' functions are now named
'have_cmd_arg' and 'cmd_arg'. A new 'have_recipe' function returns true
whenever the specified depot recipe is present. This way, the compatibility
of a run script with any board where a 'drivers_interactive' package is
defined can be expressed in a much more concise way compared to the former
enumeration of supported boards:

! assert {[have_recipe pkg/[drivers_interactive_pkg]]}

The change of the run tool is accompanied with an improvement of Genode's
autopilot tool that distinguishes unsatisfied run scripts from successfully
executed run scripts.

Thanks to Roman for this careful, tasteful, and comprehensive contribution!
