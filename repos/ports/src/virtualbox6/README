VirtualBox configuration options
================================

The configuration requires an attribute named vbox_file with the name of the
vbox configuration to be used (.vbox).

! <config vbox_file="file.vbox">

XHCI controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The virtual XHCI controller can be enabled with the following
configuration option.

! <config xhci="yes">

CapsLock
~~~~~~~~

Per default CapsLock key events are send unmodified to guest
operating systems. As guest and host state may diverge, the event
filter optionally reports the capslock state as ROM, which can be
monitored by VirtualBox if configured like follows.

! <config capslock="rom">

VirtualBox requests a "capslock" ROM, which is interpreted as XML. The
top-level node attribute 'enabled' is expected boolean and represents
the CapsLock state. If ROM and VM-internal CapsLock state differ, the
VMM sends aritifical CapsLock key events to the VM. In this mode,
incoming KEY_CAPSLOCK input events a dropped and not sent to the guest
to prevent the state divergence.

Monitors
~~~~~~~~

Virtual monitors for VirtualBox must be configured in two steps. First, the
'<Display monitorCount="<num>">' node in the .vbox file defines the number
of _connectors_ and, thus, the maximum number of connected virtual monitors.
Each enabled VirtualBox monitor requests a dedicated GUI session. Enablement
and labeling of these sessions is done via '<monitor>' nodes in the
component configuration like follows.

! <monitor label="DP-1"/>
! <monitor label="HDMI-A-1"/>

The label can be used by the window manager to configure and place the
corresponding window. The order of the nodes directly controls the
connection order at the virtual graphics card.
